# **Example Chrome Extension**

This is a Reddit Bot Chrome extension with a basic event/message passing skeleton for you to easily get started building a Chrome extension.

I've also included Mixpanel for tracking, just drop an API key associated with your project into the `mixpanel.js` file.

### MVC
- Popup script (view)
- Content script (controller)
- Background script (model)

### Purpose

I wanted to vote reddit posts automatically by a chrome extension

### Contributing

Feel free to clone this repo and submit a pull request to add other basic elements of a useful Chrome extension.
